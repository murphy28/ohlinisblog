# Ohlin Is Blog

Hello, welcome to my blog!

I'm **Ohlin Arellano**, a passionate software developer who specializes in **web development**. I love learning and putting myself to work on projects in various fields, whether that's websites, robots, CAD, graphic design, and more.

This blog is a place for me to share the things I've learned on all sorts of topics, there really is no theme. 

If you'd like to learn more about my projects, feel free to check out my [main site](https://ohlinis.me)!

Thank you for your time,<br />
Ohlin Arellano
