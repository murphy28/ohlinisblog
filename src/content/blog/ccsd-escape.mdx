Are you graduating out of CCSD? Do you want to hoard all your memories? This guide is for you. After a student is graduated, they have at most a month before all of their accounts are deleted and can no longer be accessed. Following all the steps below will help you download everything before it is too late.

Before getting into it, congrats grad!

### CCSD Google Accounts

#### Takeout
Google provides a takeout service for downloading your data in zip files. This can be found at takeout.google.com

#### Transfer

Alternatively, you can transfer your data to another Google account. 

I'd recommend [creating a new Google account](https://accounts.google.com/signup) that matches your school account. For example, if my CCSD account is under john.123456@nv.ccsd.net, create the account john.123456@gmail.com. This is personal preference, but I know I won't forget what the new account is.

Once you have a new account, you can transfer all of your data over to it. Head over to takeout.google.com/transfer on your school account. Follow the instructions there to copy all of your data to the account you just created. 

Even though you can transfer all your data to a new account, I'd still recommend downloading everything using the takeout tool, at least your Google Drive. CCSD provides accounts under the Google Workplace Suite, meaning unlimited storage. The account you just created will only have **15GB**. Please take that into consideration when backing up your data.

#### Profile Picture History

As far as I know, google takeout does not export your profile picture history. If this matters to you, go to myaccount.google.com.

At the top of the page, you'll see your current profile photo above your name. Click it. This will bring up a modal to change your photo.

Click the three dots in the top right of this modal, and select "Past profile pictures". This will show every profile photo you've ever had, as well as a way to download them all (Sadly one at a time). Back these up whichever way makes sense to you.

### CCSD Microsoft OneDrives

CCSD does give students access to Microsoft 365 accounts, at least for some students, however from my experience it was barely used. To see if you have any data on there, head over to onedrive.live.com

When prompted to sign in, there are two different sign in methods that might work. I'd try both.

Username: `john.123456@ad.ccsd.net`
Password: Same as Google Account Password

If that doesn't work, try this way:
Username: `john.123456@nv.ccsd.net`
Password: Same as Google Account Password

I couldn't tell you why there's two ways.

If you manage to log in, you might have some stuff saved on there. You can just straight up download things off of OneDrive that you would like to keep by selecting a file or folder and clicking on Download.

There may be other things to backup from here, but that's everything that I personally cared about.

### Canvas Courses

I couldn't find any pre-existing tools for exporting all of your canvas courses, so I made my own last year. That tool wasn't at all ready for public use, so I threw it through Gemini to format it to work as a Google Collab notebook. This worked perfectly for me, but of course use at your own risk.

This tool will download every module, discussion, announcement, home page, and more from every course on your canvas account. It will download to a zip file, with HTML files you can open in your browser to view your course data offline.

[Here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1OdWEfeWWIJDkUdvJaAY4Hj6-74WgDdmu) is the link to the tool on Google Collab. You'll need to be logged into a non CCSD Google Account to access this.

Once you're there, instructions are provided on how to use the tool. Note that you'll need to provide a Canvas Access Token, which allows full control over your Canvas account. Do not share it with people you do not trust. I will not have access to any tokens used on this tool.


### Student AD Drive

When you log in to a windows machine within CCSD's active directory, you're given access to a student drive that syncs between computers. If this is something you used, backing it up is as easy as copying it all to a flash drive. 

### Graduation Video

Every graduation recorded since 2022 has been made publically available at [ccsdgraduations.eduvision.tv](https://ccsdgraduations.eduvision.tv/Default)

If your graduation hasn't happened yet, you'll also be able to watch it live when it does on this website. Once it's done recording, it goes up in the archives. You can search for your school or just scroll until you find it.

Once you find your graduation video, you also have the ability to download it. Take advantage of this!
